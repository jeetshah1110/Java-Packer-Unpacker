# Java-Packer-Unpacker

* This project is used to perform packing and unpacking activity for multiple types of files.
* In the case of Packing activity, we maintain one file which contains metadata and data of multiple files from the specified directory.
* In the case of Unpacking activity, we extract all data from packed files and according to its metadata, we create all files
* This Application is similar to ZIP operation but the difference is here we don't compress files while packing activity
